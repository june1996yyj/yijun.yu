## About Me

I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at Kyoto University, with my PhD degree completed in July. My research focuses on the quantitative study of how education reform and ICT lead to women's empowerment in China and African countries (Kenya and Zimbabwe). Additionally, I have conducted qualitative research in China and UK, employing a mixed-method approach.

## Research Interests

- **Econometrics and Statistical Analysis**: Advanced coursework and practical experience in regression analysis and causal inference, utilizing tools such as Python, R, and Stata.
- **Education Policy and Gender Equality**: In-depth research on the impact of educational reforms on women's empowerment and the intersection of gender and education.
- **Survey Experiments and Data Collection**: Designing and administering surveys, both field and online, to collect and analyze data relevant to policy impacts.
